Base Codeigniter App
=====================

Note: this contains a variety of submodules. after cloning, be sure to ```git submodule update --init --recursive``` and you should be good to go.

Includes this awesome stuff:

* [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com) - application folder is outside so that we can just pull vanilla codeigniter updates.
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://bootstrap.io) - in assets/twitter_bootstrap. This is my fork of bootstrap to allow for minification of js without breaking. I keep it updated from the main repo though. (I submitted a pull request on this but they wouldn't change it due to "strong opinions about semicolons").
* [Kenji's CIUnit](https://bitbucket.org/kenjis/my-ciunit) - a fork of CIUnit (PHPUnit support for CodeIgniter applications) that works in CodeIgniter 2. This is on bitbucket in mercurial so I couldn't add it as a submodule unfortunately. The way it is set up it spreads all over the application folder anyway so it's not just a drop-in tool. For sample tests clone his repo. The version included is from January 28, 2012.
* [QUnit](https://github.com/jquery/qunit) - for JS unit testing.
* [JQuery Mockjax](https://github.com/appendto/jquery-mockjax) - excellent tool for mocking ajax requests for JS unit testing.
* [Carabiner Spark](https://github.com/mikedfunk/carabiner) - spark version of Carabiner - an asset management library. (with added [LessPHP](https://github.com/leafo/lessphp) support)
* [Sparks](http://getsparks.org) - CodeIgniter's version of Ruby Gems.

Additional tweaks:
--------------------

* Welcome page is re-done with:
 * twitter bootstrap
 * less css
 * minified and combined JS and CSS through Carabiner
 * simple template setup
* global form_validation delimiters for twitter bootstrap set in ```libraries/MY_Form_validation.php```
* htaccess from [html5boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) with codeigniter snippet at the top to remove index.php.
* multiple environment config support. There are 3 new folders inside **config/**: **Development, Production, Testing**.
 * **Development** is set in **index.php** as the config for localhost
 * **Production** is anything but localhost, typically your remote environment (staging or production)
 * **Testing** is for PHPUnit
* xss filtering is enabled
* csrf protection is enabled
* encryption key is set. (***Change this to something unique!!***)
* Session is restricted by user agent and ip address
* Session is encrypted in production environment

Permissions:
--------------------

* ```assets/cache``` needs to be writable for JS/CSS combination and minification (turned on by default)
* ```application/db_cache``` needs to be writable for database query caching to work
* ```application/cache``` needs to be writable for page caching to work
